# By default up/down are bound to previous-history and next-history
# respectively. The following does the same but gives the extra functionality
# where if you type any text (or more accurately, if there is any text between
# the start of the line and the cursor), the subset of the history starting
# with that text is searched (like 4dos for e.g.).  Note to get rid of a line
# just Ctrl-C
"\e[B": history-search-forward
"\e[A": history-search-backward

$if Bash
  # F10 toggles mc on and off
  # Note Ctrl-o toggles panes on and off in mc
  "\e[21~": "mc\C-M"

  #do history expansion when space entered
  #Space: magic-space
$endif
